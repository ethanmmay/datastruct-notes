Array
	- Fixed Size
	- Same data type
	- Array Matrices 
	
	~ Operations:
			- Traverse
			- Search
			- Update
			

Linked Lists
	- Key1 - Node2 - Node2 - Tail2
	- Node: Key and Next
	- Singly Linked: Forward traverse only
	- Doubly Linked: Forward+Backward & Node has 'prev'
	- Circular Linked: head's prev points to tail and vv
	
	~ Operations:
			- Search
			- Insert
			- Delete
			

Stacks (LIFO)
	- Used for evaluating expressions (Algebra)
	- Used to implement function calls in recursion
	
	~ Operations:
			- Push
			- Pop
			- Peek
			- isEmpty
			- isFull
			

Queues (FIFO)
	- Used to manage threads in multithreading
	- Used for priority queues
	
	~ Operations:
		- Enqueue
		- Dequeue
		
		
Hash Tables
	- Used when Direct Addressing is outscaled
	- h(key) = key % table_size (h(63) = 63 % 20 = 3)
	- Used for database indices and associative arrays
	- Used for developing the "set" data structure
	
	~ Operations:
		- Insert
		- Search
		

Trees
	- Ex: Binary Search (BST), B tree, Treap, Red-Black Tree, Splay, AVL and N-ary tree.
	- BST Hierarchical structure: key, left, right, p (parent)
	- Used when data is coming and going, like expression parsers and solvers
	- Heaps are used by JVM to store Java objects
	- Treaps are used in wireless networking
	

Heaps
	- Special Binary Tree: can be arranged based on node values
	- Min and Max heap properties for size sorting
	- Used for the heapsort algorithm
	- Used for priority queues in array form
	- Used for queue functions within O(log n) time
	- Used to find the kth smallest or largest value
	

Graphs
	- Vertices (points) and edges (lines) make up order (# of vertices) and size (# of edges)
	- Adjacent nodes are two vertices connected by same edge
	- Directed: All edges direct away from start vertex and towards end vertex. Self-loops is an edge pointing from and towards itself
	- Undirected: No specific edge direction, isolated vertices
	- Used for representing social media networks
	- Used for page documentation in search engines
