Types of Automation Testing:
	- UI Tests
	- Performance Tests
	- Regression Tests
	- Integration Tests
	- Unit Tests
	
When to automate a test:
	- Test is repeatable
	- Tested feature doesn't change behaviour frequently
	- Time-consuming for manual testing
	- Test involved complicated calculations
	- Test ensures features didn't break
	
- UI testing is often best done manually

Software Testing Tools
	- Some are code-less
	- Commerical tools are expensive but have support
	- Open Source tools are free but little to no support
	- Some tools are more complex for more complex testing
	- Ex: Selenium, Katalon Studio, UFT, TestComplete, Testim

- Testing frameworks can help build test data for tests
- Testing libraries can optimize tests and save writing time
- A good framework supports unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests
- Other tools can help easily repeat tests under high loads
- Test beds are the test data sets used to help verify cases
- Browser testing (drivers) is also done by Protractor
- Cross-browser testing can be done over different browsers and Operating Systems using SeleniumBox, BrowserStack, Browsershots and LambdaTest
- Regression tests are key to building a consistent user-base

Automation Testing Best Practices
	- Be smart about what you decide to automate
	- Organize test cases based on skill and experience
	- Remove uncertainty by triple checking tests for 0 bugs or false positives
	- Confirm that the tool you're using will save more time than it takes to learn
	- Use tools to record tests into a database
	- Document new bugs in a tracking tool with exact reproduction steps and other details about the bug
	- Try to adhere to the Test Automation Pyramid

Test Automation Pyramid
	- Have more Unit tests as they're cheaper and faster
	- Service tests can bridge the gap between Unit and UI
	- UI testing is important but fragile, slow and expensive. It can break with new features or updates
	- Mike Cohn created the concept of a test pyramid for his book "Succeeding with Agile" in 2009
	- Martin Fowler simplified the idea in 2012, replacing the integration scale with a cost scale

More Test Automation Platforms
	- Cucumber: Open-source, BDD, plain language (readable)
	- Robot Framework: Open-source, Robotic Process Automation
	
Robot Framework
	- Tries to simulate real human webpage interaction more
	- Understands (to an extent) what is on screen
	- Written in Python, Modular and uses a framework-specific syntax for test data
	- Runs test from CLI but can generate detailed XML/HTML reports
	- Good support for ArchiveLibrary, HttpRequestLibrary etc.
	- Static, Dynamic and Hybrid APIs

Automate a Basic Login
	- Test it manually to understand functionality
	- Prepare test bed with username and passwords
	- Develop test cases and note outputs for each
	- Record instances where output doesnt match expectations
	- Verify and validate outputs and redirects
	
Risks of Automated Testing
	- Negative ROI: Bad investments into learning new tools/frameworks can lose more time than it would save.
	- Tech Catchup: Tools/frameworks are constantly evolving and the deprecations may throw off a sprint
	- Maintenance Risk: Updates to features with already built tests may cause errors that need to be addressed in order to keep using the test case
	
Automation Testing Lifecycle
	- Discover scope of automated tests
	- Choose correct tools/frameworks
	- Design test plan & execution strategy
	- Set up test environment
	- Develop and execute test cases
	- Generate and analyze test reports

Automating Around Captcha
	- Captcha blocks bots from accessing parts of a site
	- Testing drivers are technically bots so it's important to build a hidden backdoor around the captcha
	- Remove backdoor before Production
	- If backdoor can't be built, testing cannot bypass captcha
	
Writing Tests Development Practices
	- Confirm tests can fail as a never-failing test is more harmful than helpful
	- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): avoid code duplication and utilize encapsulation in tests
	- Keep functions small to increase maintainability
	- Document well for new team members and future self
